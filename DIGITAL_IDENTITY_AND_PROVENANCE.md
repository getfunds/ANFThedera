# Digital Identity & On-Chain Provenance System

## Overview

ANFT has implemented a groundbreaking three-layer verification system that ensures every piece of art created on our platform has **verifiable authenticity** and **immutable proof of creation**. This system protects both creators and collectors by creating a permanent, unforgeable record of who created what, when, and how.

Think of it as a digital birth certificate for every artwork—one that can never be altered, forged, or disputed.

## The Three Pillars of Trust

### 1. **Decentralized Identity (DID)** — Your Digital Signature

#### What is it?

A Decentralized Identity (DID) is like a digital passport that proves you are who you say you are, but unlike traditional accounts, **you own and control it completely**. No central authority can take it away or manipulate it.

When you create your first NFT on ANFT, the platform helps you establish your DID on the Hedera network. This becomes your permanent creative identity.

#### Why do we use it?

- **True Ownership**: Your identity belongs to you, not to our platform or any company
- **Portability**: Your DID can be used across different platforms and services
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify that an artwork was created by the real you
- **Reputation Building**: All your creations are linked to one verifiable identity

#### How does it work?

1. **First-Time Setup**: When you're about to mint your first NFT, the system checks if you already have a DID
2. **Creation**: If you don't have one, a beautiful guided wizard walks you through creating your creator profile
3. **Blockchain Registration**: Your DID and public key are registered on Hedera, creating a permanent record
4. **Wallet Signing**: You sign the creation with your Blade Wallet, proving you authorized it
5. **Storage**: Your DID information is stored both on Hedera and locally for quick access

#### Real-World Benefits

- **Combat Art Theft**: If someone tries to claim they created your work, your DID proves otherwise
- **Build Your Legacy**: Every piece you create adds to your verified portfolio
- **Trust & Transparency**: Collectors can see a creator's complete authenticated history
- **Future-Proof**: Your identity works even if ANFT doesn't exist tomorrow

### 2. **Content Hashing** — Digital Fingerprinting

#### What is it?

A content hash is like a unique fingerprint for your artwork. It's a mathematical code generated from your image and metadata that is completely unique to that exact piece. Even the tiniest change—a single pixel, a word in the description—creates a completely different fingerprint.

#### Why do we use it?

- **Tamper Detection**: Anyone can verify the artwork hasn't been modified since creation
- **Uniqueness Guarantee**: Proves this exact version is what the creator originally made
- **Integrity Verification**: The artwork you see is exactly what was minted
- **Efficient Verification**: Instead of comparing entire images, just compare fingerprints

#### How does it work?

1. **Image Fingerprinting**: When you finalize your artwork, we compute a SHA-256 hash of the raw image bytes
2. **Metadata Fingerprinting**: We also hash your NFT's metadata (name, description, attributes)
3. **Combined Fingerprint**: These are combined into a single `contentHash` that uniquely identifies this artwork
4. **Permanent Record**: This hash is stored in multiple places:
   - In the NFT's on-chain metadata
   - In the attestation record
   - On IPFS alongside the artwork

#### Real-World Benefits

- **Authenticity Proof**: You can prove your NFT is the original, not a copy
- **Version Control**: If someone edits or modifies the artwork, the hash changes
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures files on IPFS haven't been corrupted or swapped
- **Quick Verification**: Instantly verify authenticity without downloading the whole file

---

### 3. **On-Chain Attestation** — The Permanent Truth Record

#### What is it?

An attestation is a permanent, timestamped statement recorded on the Hedera blockchain that says: *"On this date and time, this creator (DID) created this specific artwork (content hash)."* 

Think of it as a notarized certificate that can never be changed or destroyed.

#### Why do we use it?

- **Immutability**: Once recorded, it can never be altered or deleted
- **Transparency**: Anyone can independently verify the attestation
- **Timestamping**: Proves exactly when the creation occurred
- **Decentralization**: The record exists on Hedera's network, not our servers
- **Legal Weight**: Provides strong evidence of creation and ownership

#### How does it work?

1. **Attestation Creation**: After your artwork is finalized, we build an attestation record containing:
   - Your creator DID
   - The content hash of your artwork
   - Timestamp of creation
   - Creation method (AI or Digital Painting)
   - Additional metadata (image hash, IPFS CIDs)

2. **Topic Management**: Each creator has their own attestation topic on Hedera (like a personal logbook)
   - First attestation creates your topic
   - Subsequent attestations add to the same topic
   - You own and control this topic through your wallet

3. **Blockchain Submission**: The attestation is submitted to Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)
   - Your wallet signs the transaction
   - Hedera records it permanently
   - A transaction ID and sequence number are returned

4. **Verification**: Anyone can verify the attestation by:
   - Querying Hedera with the topic ID and sequence number
   - Checking that the DID, content hash, and timestamp match
   - Confirming the creator's signature

#### Real-World Benefits

- **Proof of Creation**: Undeniable evidence you created this work
- **Copyright Protection**: Timestamped proof for legal disputes
- **Provenance Chain**: Complete history of the artwork from creation to present
- **Fraud Prevention**: Impossible for someone to backdate or fake creation claims
- **Collector Confidence**: Buyers know exactly what they're getting and who made it

## The Complete Flow: From Creation to Verification

### When You Create an NFT:

1. **Identity Verification** (Step 1)
   - System checks if you have a DID
   - If not, guides you through creating one
   - Your DID is registered on Hedera

2. **Artwork Finalization** (Step 2)
   - Your image is uploaded to IPFS (permanent decentralized storage)
   - Content hashes are computed (image + metadata)
   - IPFS CIDs (content identifiers) are generated

3. **Attestation Creation** (Step 3)
   - An attestation record is built linking your DID to the content hash
   - Your attestation topic is created (first time) or reused
   - The attestation is submitted to Hedera with your wallet signature
   - You receive a permanent transaction ID

4. **NFT Minting** (Step 4)
   - The NFT is minted with complete metadata including:
     - Creator DID
     - Content hash
     - Attestation transaction ID
     - IPFS locations
     - Timestamps
   - All information is stored both on Hedera and in the NFT metadata

### When Someone Verifies Your NFT:

1. **They can check your DID**: Verify you're the real creator
2. **They can recompute the hash**: Download the artwork and verify the fingerprint matches
3. **They can query the attestation**: See the permanent Hedera record of creation
4. **They can verify IPFS**: Confirm the artwork files haven't been tampered with

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to understand blockchain to use this?

**No!** The entire system works seamlessly in the background. You'll simply:
1. Create your creator profile (one time)
2. Create your artwork
3. Click "Mint NFT"

Everything else happens automatically.

### What if I lose access to my wallet?

Your DID and attestations remain on Hedera forever, but you'd need wallet recovery to prove you control them. Always back up your wallet recovery phrase securely.

### Can I use my DID on other platforms?

Yes! Your Hedera DID is not locked to ANFT. Any platform that supports Hedera DIDs can recognize and verify your identity.

### Does this cost extra?

The small Hedera transaction fees (fractions of a cent) are already included in your minting process. There are no additional costs for DID or attestation.

### How is this different from traditional NFTs?

Most NFT platforms only record ownership transfers. We record:
- Who created it (verified DID)
- When it was created (attestation timestamp)  
- What exactly was created (content hash)
- Immutable proof it hasn't been altered

It's the difference between a sales receipt and a complete certificate of authenticity.

### Is my personal information on the blockchain?

No. Only your DID (a public identifier), content hashes, and creation timestamps are on-chain. Your name, email, and other personal details remain private.
